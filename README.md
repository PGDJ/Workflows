# Alfred Workflows
These workflows and workflow utilities are no longer maintained or updated. Under each folder, you'll find the source code for the workflow, without the icon or `Info.plist` files, and a zipped `.alfredworkflow` file that can be imported into Alfred.

Note that if you wish to import these workflows, it is recommended that you remove any lingering `update.json` files in the workflow's folder, as the server that they instruct Alleyoop to query is no longer active.
